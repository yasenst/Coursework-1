PIK 1 Coursework

This was my coursework during my 1st semester at TU-Sofia. It was created during the courses of Basiscs of Programming so it is quite simple.

A console application which takes a '.c' file (containing C code) from either console input or a file and tells you how many ';' there are in the code, also how many lines it has and the number of 'if' and 'if-else' statements. It then writes the answer either in a file or on the console.
